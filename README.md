# PISCOC1 - Multi-Platform Integration Ecosystem

A comprehensive platform for managing content across multiple social media and content management platforms including Airtable, Instagram, and more.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ 
- PostgreSQL 16+
- npm or yarn
- Railway CLI (optional, recommended for local env injection)
   'npm i -g @railway/cli'

### Local Development Setup

#### Option 1: Railway (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Login and link Railway** (for local env variables)
   ```bash
   npm i -g @railway/cli
   railway login
   railway link
   ```

4. **Start development server with Railway env**
   ```bash
   railway run npm run dev
   ```
   The app will start on `http://localhost:3000` (auto-fallbacks to `3001`, `3002`, etc. if ports are busy). HTTPS for Facebook runs on `https://localhost:3001`.

#### Option 2: Manual Setup (without Railway)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Edit `.env` and configure your API keys and database connection. See [API Keys Setup](#api-keys-setup).

4. **Set up PostgreSQL database**
   ```bash
   # Create database
   createdb [Database name]

   # Push database schema
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will start on `http://localhost:3000` (auto-fallbacks to `3001`, `3002`, etc. if ports are busy).

### Production Build

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start production server**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## üìä Features

- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Connect with Airtable, Instagram, and ImgBB
- **Content Management**: Create, edit, and manage articles across platforms
- **Team Collaboration**: Manage team members and permissions
- **API Key Management**: Centralized configuration page for all integrations
- **Real-time Status Monitoring**: Check the health of all connected services
- **Secure Authentication**: Session-based auth with role-based access control

## üîë API Keys Setup

This application integrates with multiple external services. You'll need to obtain API keys for each service you want to use:

### Required Environment Variables (SEE .env.example)

### Obtaining API Keys

#### Airtable
1. Go to [Airtable API](https://airtable.com/create/tokens)
2. Create a personal access token
3. Use the token for `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`

#### Facebook/Instagram
1. Go to [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Create a new app
3. Add Instagram Basic Display product
4. Copy App ID for `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`
5. Copy App Secret for `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`

#### ImgBB
1. Go to [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/)
2. Create an account and go to [API](https://api.imgbb.com/)
3. Get your API key
4. Copy API key for `IMGBB_API_KEY`

### Managing API Keys

Once your application is running, you can use the **API Keys** page (`/keys`) to:

- View the configuration status of all integrations
- Get step-by-step setup instructions for each service
- Copy environment variable names
- Access direct links to API registration pages
- Monitor the health of all connected services

The Keys page is accessible from the sidebar under "Integrations ‚Üí API Keys" and requires admin privileges.

## üîß Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server (HTTP). When using Railway env vars locally, run `railway run npm run dev`.
- `npm run dev:https` - Start development server with HTTPS (required for Facebook Login)
- `npm run setup:https` - Generate HTTPS certificates for local development
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run db:push` - Push database schema changes
-`npm run test:setup` - Check if you are ready to start dev session


### üîí HTTPS Setup for Facebook Integration

Facebook requires HTTPS for OAuth login. To enable this in development:

1. **Generate HTTPS certificates**:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:https
   ```

2. **Start HTTPS development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:https
   ```

3. **Access your app**:
   - **For development**: Use `http://localhost:3000` (Facebook SDK now works properly)
   - **For Facebook testing**: Use `https://localhost:3001` (may show WebSocket warnings - these are safe to ignore)

4. **Accept the security warning** when visiting `https://localhost:3001` (this is safe for localhost development)

> **Note**: The WebSocket warnings in the console when using HTTPS are harmless and don't affect Facebook functionality. For regular development, use HTTP. Use HTTPS only when testing Facebook Login specifically.

## üîê Authentication

The application uses session-based authentication. Default admin credentials will be created during first setup.

## üìö API Documentation

See [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed API endpoint documentation.

## üîß Database
Uses Postgres through Railway.

## üöÄ Development

The application serves both API and frontend from a single Express server using Vite middleware in development.

- Ensure you have Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL available, and required environment variables set (via `.env` or Railway).
- Optional checks: `npm run test:setup`, will see if everything is present to start dev server
  - With Railway env vars: `railway run npm run dev`
  - Manually: `npm run dev`
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` (falls back to `3001`, `3002`, ... if busy). For Facebook login testing, use `https://localhost:3001`.
